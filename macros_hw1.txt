Regraded for 5/5, nicely done :)

Note that I've changed "regrade_please" to "regraded" with the date, so that 
I don't accidently try to regrade twice (and I backed up your original file
with a .backup extension, just in case). If you need me to take yet another 
look for any reason, just add 

# regrade_please 

again somewhere in the code file, and I'll take a look the next time I get 
around to processing regrades (hopefully once per week).
